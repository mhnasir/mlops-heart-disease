MLOPS ASSIGNMENT – I
End-to-End ML Pipeline for Heart Disease Prediction

1. Introduction
This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps workflow for deploying a machine learning model.

2. Dataset Description
The UCI Heart Disease dataset contains patient health indicators and a binary target.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was performed to understand distributions, correlations, and class balance.

4. Feature Engineering
Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler.

5. Model Development
Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were trained and evaluated.

6. Experiment Tracking
MLflow was used to track experiments, parameters, metrics, and models.

7. CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions automates testing and training on every push.

8. Containerization
FastAPI-based inference service was containerized using Docker.

9. Deployment
The Docker image was deployed using Kubernetes manifests.

10. Conclusion
The project follows industry-standard MLOps practices and is production-ready.
